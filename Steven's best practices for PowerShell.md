# Steven's best practices for PowerShell

- Variables
  - Use Pascal Case for variables defined as parameters
  - Use Camel Case for variables defined in the code
- Use single quotes for non-expanding text and double quotes for expanding text
  - $var1 = 'this is some text'
  - $var2 = "Profile path: $PROFILE"
- Keep your line lenth below 120
  - Use the natural line continuation characters
  - Use splatting
  - Use the Join operator
- Write PowerShell functions
  - Keep your code focused and atomic
  - Helps with testing
  - Can be executed like scripts
- Use switch statements rather than complex if/elseif/else
- Learn RegEx
  - Seriously. Learn it.
  - Many operators in PowerShell use RegEx
  - VSCode search and replace can use RegEx
  - Select-String/grep use RegEx
- Writing Help
  - Give good explanations for each parameter
  - Give an example for how to use each parameter
  - Put what you think will be the most used example at the bottom of your example list
