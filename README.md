# PowerShell Scopes

Discussion and examples for PowerShell scopes

This repo is for some code and examples that are intended to help explain how scopes work in PowerShell.
I used the material from the training I delivered to the DevOps and Global Summit 2025 On Ramp Program.
Go to [PowerShell.org OnRamp](https://powershell.org/onramp/) for more information about the program.
I highly recommend that if you are getting started with PowerShell that you attend this program where you will learn from people that are passionate about PowerShell and are highly skilled in PowerShell development and also in instructing people to learn PowerShell.
